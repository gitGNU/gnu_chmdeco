	* version.h: Bump version number

	* hhp.c (recreate_hhp): Remember that prefix_size is zero after freeing;
	Fixes crash with multiple input dirs

	* misc.c (recreate_alias_map): Fixed output of alias.ali, map.h files and
	indirectly [ALIAS] & [MAP] sections in the HHP.

	* convert.c (make_FILETIME_string): Preliminary FILETIME output added,
	then removed, because it became obvious it wasn't a FILETIME.
	More testing needed
	* hhp.c (recreate_hhp): Removed FILETIME output until it is deciphered

	* hhp.c (recreate_hhp): Fixed output of input name (no more '/' at start)
