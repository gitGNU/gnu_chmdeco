%description
A program to convert the internal files of Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files back
into the authoring files used by the CHM compiler to create the CHM files in
the first place.

CHM files are used on the Micosoft Windows platform to store program
documentation, almost always in the form of HTML, with some non-standard quirks.
CHM files are a form of archive known as InfoTech Storage Format (ITSF) files
and contain some special files to implement features of the CHM viewer. On
Windows they are accessed through a kind of virtual filesystem exposed by a
dynamically loaded library. ITSF files have UTF-8 filenames and use an LZX
cruncher to compress all the files in one big chunk. Both the ITSF and the
formats of the internal CHM files are highly indexed and their designs are
all clearly optimized for read-only access.
